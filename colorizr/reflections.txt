My gem takes advantage of Ruby's metaprogramming by automatically creating the
colorizr methods from the list of colors. It also uses metaprogramming to print
out the list of colors as an example.

I spent about an hour working on this project.

The most rewarding challenge was figuring out how to use metaprogramming to not
have to write all of the methods out.

I still have room to grow in understanding exactly what's going on under the
hood in metaprogramming, but I'm sure I'll understand more as I keep working
through projects.
